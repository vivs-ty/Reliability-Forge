![Observability](https://img.shields.io/badge/monitoring-Prometheus-orange)

A practical, hands-on SRE & Cloud Engineering lab focused on automation, observability, resilience engineering, and real-world reliability patterns.

This repository is not theory-heavy.  
It is a working reliability lab for building, breaking, automating, monitoring, and fixing production-like systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Reliability Forge exists to:

- Build real-world SRE skills
- Practice automation using Bash & cloud tooling
- Implement full monitoring & observability stacks
- Simulate outages & incident response
- Apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Design resilient, cloud-native systems

This is a hands-on engineering lab — not just notes.

## 🧭 Structured Learning Path

This repository follows a progressive SRE growth roadmap:

**Phase 1 → Linux + Bash Automation**  
**Phase 2 → Monitoring & Observability**  
**Phase 3 → Infrastructure as Code**  
**Phase 4 → CI/CD Automation**  
**Phase 5 → Incident Management & Chaos Engineering**  
**Phase 6 → Cloud Architecture & Reliability Patterns**

Each phase builds toward production-level reliability engineering.

## 🧪 Engineering Philosophy

> “Hope is not a strategy. Observability is.”

Everything in this repository follows these principles:

- Automate repetitive work
- Measure everything
- Design for failure
- Minimize blast radius
- Document learnings
- Test backups
- Treat infrastructure as code

Every component here is production-inspired and failure-tested.

## ✅ Production Readiness Checklist

Before calling any system “production-ready”:

- [ ] Monitoring implemented
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Infrastructure defined in code
- [ ] Backups tested
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan defined
- [ ] Runbooks documented
- [ ] Failure scenarios tested
- [ ] Observability validated

---

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Production-grade Bash utilities
- [ ] Fully automated Terraform environment
- [ ] Complete monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
- [ ] Incident simulation environment
- [ ] Chaos experiments
- [ ] Multi-cloud deployment example
- [ ] Architecture design case studies

## 🤝 Who Is This For?

- SRE aspirants
- Cloud Engineers
- DevOps Engineers
- Backend engineers moving into infrastructure
- Engineers preparing for production-scale systems

---

## 📚 Why This Repository Is Different

This is not:

- A list of random DevOps links
- A copy-paste tutorial collection
- A script dump
- A theory notebook

This is a structured, evolving reliability lab built to simulate real-world engineering challenges.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reliability-forge.git
cd reliability-forge
```

Start with:

```
/bash-scripts
```

Progress toward:

```
/terraform → /monitoring → /incident-playbooks
```

Build. Break. Observe. Improve.
