# 🔥 Reliability Forge

> Where Infrastructure Becomes Resilient

A practical, hands-on SRE & Cloud Engineering lab focused on automation, observability, resilience engineering, and real-world reliability patterns.

This repository is not theory-heavy.
It is a working command center for learning, building, breaking, and fixing production-like systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Reliability Forge exists to:

- Build real SRE skills
- Practice automation using Bash & cloud tools
- Implement monitoring & observability stacks
- Simulate outages & incident response
- Apply Infrastructure as Code
